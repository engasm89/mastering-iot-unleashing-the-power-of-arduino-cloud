## Overview

Publish sensor data as JSON over serial to represent sending telemetry to the Arduino IoT Cloud. This pattern underpins dashboards and automation rules.

## Code Explained

- Reads an analog temperature sensor and converts the raw value to Celsius.
- Formats a JSON payload and prints it over serial.
- Operates at a 1 second interval.

## How To Use

- Connect a sensor to `A0` and adjust the conversion to match your sensor.
- Replace the serial publish with the real Arduino IoT Cloud client in your environment.
